        "description": "A man (age 24) was sitting on a bench in a garden when a lady (age 34) came running\r\ntowards him, waving her hand, and said excitedly, \u201cHi!\u201d The man replied, confused, \u201cHi?\u201d\r\nHe did not remember meeting this woman before.\r\n\r\nThe lady said, \u201cYou are extremely handsome.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man responded, \u201cAre you being sarcastic?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe woman replied, \u201cNo, you actually are very handsome, and it\u2019s really great meeting you.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man said, \u201cSit, sit\u2026 tell me more about yourself. Don\u2019t you consider the society you live\r\nin before speaking?\u201d He offered her a seat. She sat down and started laughing.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou already know the answer\u2026 I do not,\u201d she said.\r\n\r\nThe man was now creeped out. He had never in his life seen or heard of such an absurd\r\nincident happening to anyone. He asked, \u201cOkay, so why are you here? May I help you with\r\nsomething?\u201d\r\n\r\nShe said, \u201cAre you free at the moment? I just want to talk to you\u2026 I have no one to talk to. I\r\njust wanted to talk and maybe do some productive activities.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cProductive activities?\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou know? Communication is way, way, way overlooked. For example, ask me a question\r\nthat relates to the most recent thing I did and you\u2019re curious about why I did it,\u201d she said.\r\n\r\nHe asked, \u201cWhy did you laugh after sitting?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe woman replied, \u201cThat was fast\u2026 okay, so now let\u2019s go talk to that vegetable vendor\r\noutside the garden.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe held his hand and took him to the vegetable vendor. She said, \u201cBhaiya, aapki biwi\r\nbacchi mere basement mai band hai.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe vendor said carelessly, \u201cKya bol rahi ho madam? Subha subha paka rahi ho\u2026 aapko\r\nkuch chaiye to boliye varna ye sab karna to baat na kariye.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man was simply observing as he understood nothing. She said, \u201cUska massa phord\r\ndiya maine.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe vendor started shouting, \u201cAyee, kya chal raha tum log kaa? Sir, aapki biwi kya bol rahi\r\nhai? Isko bolo chup ho jaye! Kya kiya mere biwi bacchi ko tumne? Kuch nahi kiya, mujhe\r\npata hai\u2026 jhut bol rahi hai\u2026 kya chaiye tumhe?\u201d\r\n\r\nShe interrupted the vendor, \u201cBhaiya ji, hum mazak kar rahe the\u2026 do nimbu de dijiye.\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter handling the situation, they went back to the bench, where the woman said, \u201cActually,\r\nhe was worried not about his wife he was somewhat sure that I did nothing but all his\r\nworry was for his daughter. His wife doesn\u2019t have a mole, but his daughter does. I made a\r\nwrong claim, so he\u2019s sure that I didn\u2019t do anything to his wife. But there was information\r\nabout his daughter that he didn\u2019t want to share, and that\u2019s what resulted in him\r\ncontradicting himself in what he was saying and what he was showing in the last line.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man asked, \u201cHow did you know his daughter has a mole?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe woman replied, \u201cEducated guess? There\u2019s a chance that I misinterpreted the whole\r\nthing, and he was maybe worried about a completely different thing? Could be, right?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man asked, \u201cWhat do you mean? What is the meaning of this whole act? What is the\r\nmeaning of this entire encounter? What is the meaning of everything you just said and also\r\nwhatever you said previously?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe woman responded, \u201cCommunication is much deeper than what we think. We say\r\nthings we don\u2019t mean, or we say things we never said but that get inferred due to lack of\r\nknowledge about the human you are making judgments about, or due to lack of clarity from\r\nthe human who made the statement. If there is something you never said and people took\r\nit as if you said it, it\u2019s your fault. You, yourself alone, are responsible for all the pleasure and\r\npain you experience. And also, about it making sense why does it have to make sense?\r\nLack of knowledge about a situation makes it look absurd, but if you\u2019re on the right road, no\r\none will complain about you stopping way before the destination.\u201d\r\n\r\n(Looking at the camera) \u201cI know this is a little too deep for a two minute thing, but if I would\r\nlike you to summarize everything in one word, it is called HONESTY.\u201d\r\n\r\nSuddenly, men in white t shirts and pants parked their ambulance outside the garden and\r\nrushed towards the woman. They held her hands as one guy said, \u201cReally sorry, sir, this\r\nwoman ran away from a mental asylum. I hope she didn\u2019t trouble you.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe woman said, \u201cHere are the people who lock sanity away to let insanity exist freely.\r\nAnyways, bye bye, handsome.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man said, \u201cActually, she is my wife\u2026 I\u2019ll go with you\u201d\r\n\r\nThe woman interrupted, \u201cI am married. And yeah, also loyal\u2026 I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man said, \u201cI don\u2019t care, come home. I have a whiteboard. Teach me.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe woman replied, \u201cI\u2019ll make it simple for you: please don\u2019t marry me, hahaha.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man said, \u201cSo?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe woman replied, \u201cSo bye bye.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe left. Meanwhile, the vendor called home, where his daughter started crying on the call\r\nand said, \u201cPapa, ek aurat aake mera massa khaa gayi.\u201d",
